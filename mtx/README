MTX

Programs:
  mtx is the media changer control program
  tapeinfo dumps some interesting stuff out of tape drives' mode pages and
sense pages. 

INSTALLATION:

WARNING: MUST HAVE GNU 'make' TO DO THIS! (e.g. use 'gmake' on freebsd, not
BSD 'make'!).

Edit 'Makefile' to set the appropriate target (e.g. "freebsd86" or "linux86"),
and to set install location for the binary and man page. Type 'make', then
'make install'. Type 'man mtx' for info about mtx, and 'man tapeinfo'
for info about tapeinfo. Enjoy.

dynamically allocating element info, Tien That Ton of Tandberg for
being the original tester of the Import/Export Element stuff, Ken

 and to all the other people out there who have used it, found
 problems with it, and let me know about it (you know who you are).
